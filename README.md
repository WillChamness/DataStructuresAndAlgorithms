# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

This repo contains the code of various data structures and algorithms along with explanations of each. 
Written in Python, the DSAAs are written from scatch with as little help as possible from
built-in modules. 

## Purpose of this Repo
I will document as much as possible so that you can get an idea of how to recreate these in other languages.
For example when implementing a queue, I see some repos simply appending to the end of a list to enqueue and popping 
at the beginning to dequeue. While this is a perfectly valid implementation in Python, this does not necessarily work in other
languages, e.g. Java.
